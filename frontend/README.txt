Steps to Start the Angular Frontend

1. Open a new terminal (you can keep the backend terminal open) and navigate to your Angular project directory.

Install dependencies (if you haven't already). Run this command to ensure all necessary packages are installed:


`npm install`

2. Start the Angular development server using:

`ng serve`

By default, the Angular app will run on http://localhost:4200. Open your web browser and navigate to this URL to see your frontend application in action.
